Here are two sample screenshots of the output, one with a discount applied and one without. These illustrate how your billing system looks and functions.

## Getting Started

1. **Import the Billing_System Class**: In your Python script, import the `Billing_System` class from the `BillingSystem` module.

2. **Create an Instance**: Initialize an instance of the `Billing_System` class to start the billing process.

3. **Add Items**: Begin by adding items to the bill using the `add_items()` method. Provide item names, quantities, and prices as prompted.

4. **Continue or Apply Discount**: After adding items, you can choose to continue adding more items or apply a discount to the bill using the `discount()` method.

5. **View the Bill**: To view the final itemized bill, call the `display_bill()` method. The bill includes total quantities, total price (with or without discount), and a thank you message.

6. **Customer Encouragement**: The system concludes with a message encouraging customers to return and have a smooth shopping experience.

7. **Customize**: Feel free to explore and customize the code to fit your specific business requirements.
